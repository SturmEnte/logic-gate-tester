# logic-gate-tester

## About
This program can test all typical typical three-pin types of logic gates (and, or, xor, nand, nor, xnor). It will test all possible connection combinations and will then compare the results of the test to the expected results of the different logic gate types and will then print the result in the serial monitor.

## How to connect the pins
The A, B, and Y pins must all be connected to the input pins of a logic gate, but it doesn't matter if for examaple pin A is also connected to the logic gate's input pin A, because the program automatically connects pin A to all three pins that are set at the top of the programs code. The program will do the same with the B and Y pins. An example of how the logic gate can be connected is shown in the image below.
